        You have two sets of document names, each containing various topics. Your task is to determine if a given question can be answered solely based on the document names. Analyze only the document names and do not assume any additional content.

        Here are the document sets:

        Set A:"{set_1}"
        Set B: "{set_2}"

        Instructions for response:

        If Set A likely contains the answer, return 1.
        If Set B likely contains the answer, return 2.
        If neither contains the answer, return 3.
        If both sets contain relevant information, choose the set that is more specific and detailed.
        If you are unsure whether the question can be answered using these document names, return 3
        Now, analyze the following question and determine the appropriate response.
